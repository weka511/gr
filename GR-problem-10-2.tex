\begin{abstract}
Find the change in time of the radius of a double--star system due to the gravitational radiation. Initial distance between the stars is 2R and their masses are $m_1$ and $m_2$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item correct components of the quadruple tensor
	\item correct expression for the radiation intensity
	\item correct expression for the velocity of the distance decrease
	\item time dependence of the distance
\end{enumerate}
